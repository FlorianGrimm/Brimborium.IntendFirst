# Documentation

Hope: a good way to program.

My observation:

Agil/Scrum/Waterfall defines the tasks for a programmer written by non-programmers.
Syntax Rules, TDD,... defines how a program should be written progress.
Their is a deep gap between the different groups build with wording and knowledge.
IMHO: A successfull project was done by people that look beyond their own horizon.

Goal:

- A orthogonal, independet process / tooling.
- Write your tasks / ideas / rules / contraints in a way that you can understand.
- A translation from buissness to deep technical.
- So you can stay focused on your litte micro task.
- Add references from code to documentation - since a task might result in different code locations / checkins.
- Document your deep thougts / failuers so other (and future you) can profit. 
- A Change Request can be confusing, since you have new changed code that respect the change and old code that doesn't - you cannot change all code at once.
- So your interested fellow campaigners might understand your toughts.
- A little bit better might help - readjust the goals.
