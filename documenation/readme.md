# Documentation


Goal:

- A process / tooling.
- Write your tasks / ideas / rules / constraints in a way that you can understand.
- A translation from business to deep technical.
- So you can stay focused on your little micro task.
- Add references from code to documentation - since a task might result in different code locations / check-ins.
- Document your deep thoughts / failures so other (and future you) can profit. 
- A Change Request can be confusing, since you have new changed code that respect the change and old code that doesn't - you cannot change all code at once.
- So your interested fellow campaigners might understand your thoughts.
- A little bit better might help - readjust the goals.
